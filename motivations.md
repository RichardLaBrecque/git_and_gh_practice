# Why I'm changing careers at 35

All I have ever known is my families business, It's what I grew up in.
I spent my childhood working with my father, and took over the company at 27.
Its a hard phyical job, and I have watched my father work his tail off my whole life,
He has sacrifed his body, his health, and his savings keeping things going.
Yes, we have had some success. And my family has been taken care of, enough so that i can afford to take this chance and change jobs.
My father needs to retire, and finding help in the construction industry has been very difficult.  
I dont want to punish my body anymore, to come home exausted and gross from working on nasty jobs
At retirement, all my father has is the money hes saved himself, and our equipment to sell for money in his pocket.
I want better than that for me, and for my daughter who just turned 1.  She deserves a father whos not exausted every day. who has free time on weekends and nights to play.
Im lucky enough to be able to take this chance, and I'll do it for her.
